# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository for Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects! This repository serves as a collection of various data analysis and machine learning tasks I've undertaken, showcasing my skills in data manipulation, model building, visualization, and interpretation.

As I continue to learn and grow, I will be adding more exciting projects to this repository.

## Projects

Below is a detailed overview of the projects currently hosted in this repository:

### 1. Cricket IPL Player Performance Analysis

* **File:** `1.Cricket_IPL.ipynb`
* **Description:** This project analyzes cricket player performance data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) across multiple seasons. The primary goal is to identify the most consistent players based on key batting and bowling statistics such as strike rate, average, and economy rate.
* **Key Tasks Performed:**
    * Data loading and initial exploration.
    * Calculation of performance metrics (e.g., strike rate, bowling average, economy rate) for each player per season.
    * Analysis of consistency by calculating the standard deviation of performance metrics across seasons.
    * Identification and visualization of top consistent batters and bowlers.
    * Identification of players with the most runs, 4s, 6s, and wickets.
* **Insights:** The analysis revealed insights into consistent performers and top-performing players in various categories, highlighting their stability and impact on the game.
* **Next Steps (as per notebook):** Further analysis could explore the correlation between consistency and overall performance, and investigate factors contributing to player stability.

### 2. GDP vs. Happiness Index Analysis

* **File:** `2.GDP_vs_Happiness_Index.ipynb`
* **Description:** This project investigates the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and its happiness score using datasets from the World Bank and the World Happiness Report. The analysis includes global and regional correlation studies.
* **Key Tasks Performed:**
    * Loading and preparing the datasets by selecting relevant columns: 'Country', 'Region', 'Economy (GDP per Capita)', and 'Happiness Score'.
    * Visualization of the global relationship using scatter plots.
    * Calculation of the global correlation coefficient between GDP per capita and Happiness Score.
    * Segmentation of the analysis by region to observe regional variations in the relationship.
* **Insights:** A strong positive global correlation was found, but regional variations highlighted different economic and happiness dynamics. Some regions showed strong positive correlations, while others exhibited weaker or even negative correlations (though the latter may be influenced by data limitations).
* **Next Steps (as per notebook):** Further investigation is needed to understand anomalies (e.g., negative correlations in certain regions) and to explore other potential factors influencing happiness beyond economic indicators (e.g., social support, life expectancy).

### 3. Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

* **File:** `3.Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`
* **Description:** This project performs customer segmentation for a retail store using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the "Mall Customers Dataset". The objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on their annual income and spending score to enable targeted marketing strategies.
* **Key Tasks Performed:**
    * Loading and preparing the dataset.
    * Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
    * Applying K-Means clustering to segment customers.
    * Visualizing the identified clusters to understand their characteristics.
    * Interpreting the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., "Premiums," "Impulsives," "Careful Spenders," "Frugal").
* **Insights:** Five distinct customer segments were identified based on income and spending habits, providing valuable insights for tailored marketing and product recommendations.
* **Next Steps (as per notebook):** Develop targeted marketing campaigns for each segment and further analyze demographic data (Gender, Age) within each cluster for more personalized strategies.

### 4. social_media_behavior using K-Means ,PCA and silhouette_score

* **File:** `4.social_media_behavior.ipynb`
* **Description:** This project analyzes cricket player performance data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) across multiple seasons. The primary goal is to identify the most consistent players based on key batting and bowling statistics such as strike rate, average, and economy rate.
* **Key Tasks Performed:**
    * Data loading and initial exploration.
    * Calculation of  metrics (e.g., Likes & Shares) for each post.
    * Analysis of consistency by calculating the standard deviation of performance metrics .
    * The PCA-transformed data, when visualized with the identified clusters, shows distinct          groupings in the reduced-dimensional space, confirming the separation of the identified         user engagement groups.
    * Hierarchical clustering was applied to the scaled data, resulting in 3 distinct clusters.
    * t-SNE dimensionality reduction was successfully applied, and the visualization showed the       distribution of data points in a 2D space,colored by the hierarchical cluster assignments.
    * Identification and visualization of posts.
* **Insights:** The identified clusters represent distinct social media user engagement patterns based on likes and shares, which could be used for targeted content strategies.
* **Next Steps (as per notebook):** While the silhouette score identified 4 as the optimal number for KMeans, visualizing these 4 clusters using t-SNE or other dimensionality reduction techniques could provide further qualitative insight into their separation and structure.
